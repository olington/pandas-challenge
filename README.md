Challenge 4
result shows that the variation in the outcomes based on School Size is not really significant with students in schools of less than 1000 students performing slightly better in maths and reading than comparatively larger schools with between 1000-2000 students or even those with the largest size between 2000-5000. 
2 CONCLUSIONS
•	The average Maths and Reading scores were identical at approximately 70 for both subjects.
•	Comparing Government with Independent Schools' performance showed 3 independent schools out of 5 being top performers while just 1 out of the 5 bottom performing schools was independent. This could imply that overall, the independent schools have a higher pass rate than government.
